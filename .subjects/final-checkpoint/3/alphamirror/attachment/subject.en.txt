## alphamirror

### Instructions

# create folder '/alphamirror' in 'piscine' folder and put your main.go
Write a program called `alphamirror` that takes a `string` as argument and displays this `string` after replacing each alphabetical character with the opposite alphabetical character.

The case of the letter remains unchanged, for example :

'a' becomes 'z', 'Z' becomes 'A'
'd' becomes 'w', 'M' becomes 'N'

The final result will be followed by a newline (`'\n'`).

If the number of arguments is different from 1, the program prints a new line.

### Usage

```console
$ go run . "abc"
zyx$
$
$ go run . "My horse is Amazing." | cat -e
Nb slihv rh Znzarmt.$
$
$ go run .
$
```
